# MapRando-NX
Super Metroid Map Rando Utility for Switch Homebrew. Change settings just like the web ui, with the important settings (for me at least) present. Also supports saving settings. 

## How to use

You'll need the MapRando-NX zip and an unmodified Super Metroid JU Rom (MD5: `21F3E98DF4780EE1C667B84E57D88675`). Download the Zip from the releases page. Extract to the root of the SD card. Open `/config/MapRando-NX/config.txt`. Add the path to your SM rom and set the output folder for the Map Rando roms. You can also set your spoiler token if you wish. You can use copy the one from you browser by going to https://maprando.com/ > Inspect > Storage > Local Storage > And copy the value from `spoilerToken`.

### Thanks

Thanks to MstrVLT for the initial ImGui port to Switch. And thanks to the entire Map Rando team!
